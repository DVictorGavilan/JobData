# 📊 JobData

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based web scraper and ETL pipeline** designed to collect job offer data from **multiple job portals**. It is built with scalability in mind to support scraping from various employment websites. 

Currently, the implementation supports:
- **[Tecnoempleo](https://www.tecnoempleo.com)** (a leading Spanish tech job board).

It covers the full data pipeline:

- Web scraping of job listings
- ETL process (Extract → Transform → Load)
- Data quality validation using custom-defined rules
- Automated unit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability

The final dataset is stored in **CSV format**, ready for data analysis or integration into business intelligence systems.

For any bugs or questions, please contact [Dani Gavilán](mailto:danigavipedro96@gmail.com).
